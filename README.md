This is a simple react project where I have learned to use Tailwind CSS and React Props to create dynamic components.

## What I Learned

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
- **React Props**: Passing data to child components through props in React.
- **Component Creation**: Learned how to create reusable and modular components.

## Components

The project contains the following components:

- **Card**: A component that displays a card with an image, title, price, and a unique identifier.
